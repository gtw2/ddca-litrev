\section{ Demand-driven deployment models}
To predict the market demand inside of nuclear fuel cycle simulators, various algorithms
can be implemented. These can be divided into three major
branches, Non-optimizing, Deterministic Optimizing, and Stochastic
Optimizing. Each vary in complexity, which leads to a difference
in computing time and accuracy. The groups and examples of each are 
explained in detail below. 

\subsection{Non-Optimizing(NO)}

Non-optimizing algorithms predict future deployment schedules
only based on historical supply-demand data of the simulator. These algorithms do not attempt
to minimize the difference of the produced quantity to the demand,
thus the name non-optimizing. The simple nature of this class of algorithms
allows fast execution time, but only limited precision. The
two non-optimizing algorithms explored in this paper are \gls{ARMA}
and \gls{ARCH} methods. 

\subsubsection{Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)}

\gls{ARMA} is a combination of two models, the Autoregressive
and the Moving Average model. The Autoregressive model 
predicts future values with a linear curve fit of the latest
datasets, and the Moving Average method does so by fitting the 
errors \cite{stine_introduction_2011}.

The model is referred to as ARMA(p,q), where the p and q represent 
the order (number of previous time step values fitted) of the autoregressive,
and the moving average parts,
respectively. 
The \gls{ARMA} model can be represented by the following equation:

\begin{align} 
	X_i&=c + \epsilon_t + {\mathlarger{\sum}}_{i=1}^{p}\theta_i \cdot X_{t-i}+
	 {\mathlarger{\sum}}_{j=1}^{q}\phi_j\cdot\epsilon_{t-j}\\
	X_i&= \mbox{next predicted value of the time series}\\
	c&= \mbox{adjustable constant}\\
	\theta_i&=i^{th} \mbox{parameter}\\
	\phi_i&=j^{th} \mbox{parameter of the moving average system}\\
	\epsilon &= \mbox{white noise}
\end{align}


\gls{ARMA} is applied to a 'well behaved' set of time series data,
where there is little volatility. This makes \gls{ARMA} a suitable
candidate for demand prediction for constant increase of number of
reactors (caused by a constant increase of power demands).


\subsubsection{Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH)}
The \gls{ARCH} model is similar to the \gls{ARMA} model, except that
it uses previous variance terms to calculate current error terms, instead
of the value itself. This allows the model to be used in high volatile 
time series like prediction of inflation or stock prices over time 
\cite{bollerslev_generalized_1986}.
The \gls{ARCH} model can be represented by the following equation:

\begin{align}
	\epsilon_t^2 = \alpha_0+{\mathlarger{\sum}}_{i=1}^{q}\alpha_i\cdot\epsilon_{t-1}^2\\
	\alpha_i= i^{th} \mbox{parameter of the conditional heteroskedastic model}
\end{align}


In a general sense, a comprehensive fuel cycle simulator would require
predictive capabilities for volatile environments, such as economics.
In such a case, the \gls{ARCH} model may become the more preferred model
over the \gls{ARMA} model.



\subsection{Deterministic-Optimizing (DO)}
Deterministic-Optimizing algorithms use linear algebra to
reach optimization of the objective function, which is
constrained by various parameters. Compared to stochastic
optimizing algorithms, deterministic-optimizing algorithms
require less computing power, and is replicable. The most
widely used class of deterministic optimizing algorithm
is the \gls{LP} model. Simply put, this model optimizes a
linear objective function where the variables are constrained
by multiple constraints.

For a demand-driven deployment scenario, an example can be made,
where the following criterion are expressed in mathematical equations.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] Objective Function : Minimize deployed facility capacity
	\item[] Constraints:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Power demand
		\item fuel supply - mining / fabrication / enrichment /reprocessing
	\end{enumerate}
		
\end{itemize}



Two major models that utilize deterministic-optimizing algorithms are
\gls{GCAM} and \gls{MARKAL}. \gls{GCAM} explores consequences to global
change by representing various aspects of economy, energy and the environment 
\cite{edmonds_advanced_1994}.
\gls{MARKAL} is a energy demand driven model that assesses the value of new
energy technologies \cite{fishbone_markal_1981}. The optimization algorithms adopted
by these models are further explained below.

\subsubsection{ \gls{GCAM}}
The \gls{GCAM} is a dynamic-recursive model that connects various
social, economical, political decisions to climate change. 
%something here?
It determines the price vector that satisfies all markets by
utilizing the GCAM solver, which finds the root of $\vec{y} = F(\vec{p})$,
where $F(\vec{p})=0$. It does so by using two solver algorithms, the Bisection Method,
and the Broyden's Method \cite{patel_gcam_2016-1}. 

\paragraph{Bisection Method}
The Bisection Method finds the root, or $f(x)=0$, by first
getting two x values that have opposite signs. Its flow is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Initial upper and lower bounds, $x_l$ and $x_u$, respectively are set,
	so that $f(x_l) \cdot f(x_u) <0 $.
	\item Then the midpoint, $x_m$, is set, by $x_m = \frac{x_l+x_u}{2}$.
	\item Then $f(x_l) \cdot f(x_m)$ is evaluated. If the result is negative,
	then $x_u$ is updated to $x_m$. If the result is positive, $x_l$ is updated
	to $x_m$. If the result is zero, $x_m$ is the root, and the loop is stopped.
	\item Using the new $x_l$ or $x_u$ value, a new $x_m$ value is computed. Then
	$\epsilon_{x_m}$ is calculated to see if it is smaller than a pre-specified tolerance,
	input by the user. If it is, the loop is stopped, and $x_m$ is the output.
	%maybe actually write out $\epsilon_a=\frac{x_m^new-x_m^old}{x_m^new} \cdot 100
	\item If the $\epsilon_{x_m}$ is higher than the tolerance, steps 3 and 4 are repeated.
\end{enumerate}


The Bisection Method has the advantage that it requires little computing time
to 'get close' to a solution. However, in a system of equations with multiple
dimensions, it is sometimes not possible to even have rigorous bounds around 
a solution. Thus, in \gls{GCAM}, the Bisection Method is used to get the 
solver only 'near' the solution, then finds the solution using the Broyden's Method.

\paragraph{Broyden's Method}
Broyden's Method is similar to Newton's method, but it saves computing 
time by updating the Jacobian rather than computing it at every iteration. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Guess initial x value, $x_0$.
\item Evaluate $J(x_0)$ and $f(x_0)$.
\item Calculate $J^{-1}(x_0).$
\item Calculate $x_1 = x_0-J^{-1} \cdot (x_0) \cdot f(x_0)$.
\item Calculate $\Delta F$, $\Delta x$, $\Delta x^T$, $|x|^2$.d
\item Update Jacobian using $J_n = J_{n-1}+ \frac{\Delta F_n - J_{n-1} \cdot \Delta
	 x_n}{|x_n|^2} \cdot \Delta x_n^T $.
\item Repeat from step 4, but with $x_{n+1}$. Repeat so that $f(x_n)$ is less than the 
convergence criterion.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\gls{MARKAL}}

\gls{MARKAL} uses a general linear-programming algorithm to 
optimize multiple objective functions, namely cost, security and
other environmental functions, given a collection of constraints.
The variables and the functions are listed in detail in the reference
\cite{fishbone_markal_1981} \cite{abilock_users_1979}. 


\paragraph{Multi-objective linear-programming.}
The optimization algorithm in \gls{MARKAL} is a collection
of objective functions, subject to a collection of constraints.
Multi-objective linear programming is used in various applications,
such as economics, finance, engineering design, and power systems
\cite{dorfman_linear_1958}.
It is used in cases where there are competing objectives that need
an optimal decision. For example, a central bank may decide a monetary 
policy to optimize its objectives to lower inflation, unemployment, 
or interest rates. 
 
The mathematical representation is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] Minimize:
	\[(\sum_i c_i \cdot X_i) \]
	\item[]subject to:
	\[ \sum_i a_{ji} \cdot X_i \ \leq , \geq \  b_j \] \quad \textrm{and} \quad \[ 	X_i \geq 0 \]
	
\end{itemize}
	
	

Though it looks simple, the objective function and the
constraints are complex models of the relations between
numerous parameters. \gls{MARKAL} creates a matrix
of all the coefficients for the \gls{LP} problem, and is
solved. 


\subsection{Stochastic-Optimizing (SO)}
Stochastic optimization refers to optimization methods
that incorporate randomness in either the objective function
or the constraints \cite{lauren_stochastic_2015}. It aims to find
the roots for the objective function by generating random variables.
This makes it fit for problems that contain uncertainty, which
real world problems mostly are. 
The random variables are defined by a probability distribution
or sometimes just a few values.

Mathematically, the method attempts to find properties of $f$ without
evaluating $f$ directly, but by using random samples of $F(\theta, \xi).$

\begin{align}
	f(\theta)= E_{\xi} [F(\theta, \xi)] \\
	\xi = \mbox{random variable} \\
	f(\theta) = \mbox{objective function} \\
	F(\theta,\xi) = \mbox{ random samples created} \\
\end{align}

A few examples of the Stochastic-Optimizing method are
the Markov Switching Model and Gaussian Process Regression.


\subsubsection{Markov Switching Model}
The Markov Switching Model depends on the idea that
the future is independent of the past and only dependent
on the present. It utilizes Markov Chains, which 
characterize the probability of a system transitioning
between states.

The Markov Model is used in a wide variety of applications,
such as predicting exchange rates \cite{engel_can_1994}, 
labor markets \cite{krolzig_a_2002} to search trends \cite{bergamaschi_a_2011}.

The Markov Switching Model uses two types of equations:
measurement and transition equations \cite{ansari_predicting_2015}.
The measurement equations determine how hidden states affect observed data,
and transition equations define how the states evolve over time.
The model is represented with the following equations:

\begin{align}
	y_t &=a_{0,0} + a_{0,1} S_t + (a_{1,0}+a_{1,1} S_t) y_{t-1} +e_i \\
	P_{ij}&=P(S_t=j | S_{t-1} = i) \\
	y_t &= \mbox{observable random variable} \\
	a &= \mbox{drift term constant} \\
	S_t &= \mbox{hidden state variable} \\ 
	e_i &= \mbox{error} \\
	P_{ij} &= \mbox{probability of a transition in the hidden state variable}  
\end{align}


\subsection{Gaussian Process Regression}
Gaussian Process Regression distributes a function as a Gaussian Process
characterized by a mean function and a covariance function \cite{melo_gaussian_2012}.
The mean value denotes the most probable output, and the covariance is the measure
of confidence.
